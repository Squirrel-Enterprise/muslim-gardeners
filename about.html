      <p class="heading">About</p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; I grew up gardening and growing food with my father on a small plot outside the city of Montreal, where we lived.  I still remember it as the best times of my childhood, playing outside with the worms and running out to pick a bowl of peppers for dinner.  I especially remember all of the sharing: several times each summer, my parents would fill up bags and send us, the children, to give it to the neighbors.
      <br><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast forward to 2014.  After 10 years without garden, I finally found a small plot where I could dip my hands in the sun-warmed soil and grow my beloved plants.  The last two years were wonderment and an amazing experience for me; we began a garden that inspired many people.  Adults were fascinated by the bounty of the garden, and many ended up planting their own and succeeded beautifully.  The neighborhood's kids were always stopping by to try a tomato, a ground cherry or a cucumber.  Every bug was an interest to them, and they even got to watch a spider wrap her dinner with silk!
      <br><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been teaching gardening to adults and kids for a few years and W will never tire from seeing the looks on everyone's faces as they plant their first seed and see it grow!  Join me on this journey to learn and discover.  I am very happy to share what I know and will be even happier to research any information I am missing to make sure we all learn together.
      <br><br>
      May your lives be filled with plants and sunshine!
      <br>
